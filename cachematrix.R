## In this example we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to 
## assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from 
## the current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create 
## a special object that stores a matrix  and cache's its inverse.

## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
m<-NULL
  set<-function(y){
  x<<-y
  m<<-NULL
}
get<-function() x
setmatrix<-function(solve) m<<- solve
getmatrix<-function() m
list(set=set, get=get,
   setmatrix=setmatrix,
   getmatrix=getmatrix)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created 
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has 
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the
## computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value 
## of the inverse in the cache via the setmatrix function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
 m<-x$getmatrix()
    if(!is.null(m)){
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    matrix<-x$get()
    m<-solve(matrix, ...)
    x$setmatrix(m)
    m
         ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
